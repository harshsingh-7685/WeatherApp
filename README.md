# Weather Android App
This basic Weather App project was created as part of a personal learning exercise to understand Android app development fundamentals better. This app was intended to fetch and display simple weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features
* __Basic Structure__: The project has a foundational structure for an Android Weather app. This includes layout and activity logic.
* __Weather Details__: Displays temperature, wind, sunrise, sunset, etc information.
* __UI Design__: App has a simple, clean user interface.

## Current State
__Status__: This project is not fully functional and crashes during use. The basic code structure and components have been implemented, but other issues prevent the app from running as intended.

## Disclaimer
This project was initially created as a learning exercise and was adapted from a YouTube tutorial. The codebase is a foundation for understanding basic Android app development but does not represent an original or production-ready implementation.

## Future Implementations
* Fix crashes and ensure the app runs correctly.
* Add the ability for users to enter their locations.
* Enchance error handling.
